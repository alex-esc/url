An interface for creating, editing and publishing documents, that unlike today's Web, is more in line with Tim Berners-Lee's vision for the World Wide Web. This tool makes web pages easily editable without prior coding knowledge. No HTML or CSS skills needed, just sign in and edit like a Word document.
